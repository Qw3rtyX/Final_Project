- Deleted entire script and had to restart (obviously did not mean to delete it, 
                                             was user error of course...)

- Finished entire script up until the last two defs

2022-04-29
- Finished the whole script to the best of my abilities
- Attempted to solve errors
- Had issues with GitHub Desktop but found a way around them

Considering the issues I had with having to remake the majority of the script,
it is not how it would have been if it had not been deleted. I was not able to 
put any more effort into it than I did however, because of my five other classes.
